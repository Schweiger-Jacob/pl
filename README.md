# pl
A command line program to keep of how many episodes of a show you've watched and automatically play the next one. In order to use it you must build a jar and then alias pl to run the jar in your bashrc. There are 2 files stored in a folder calle '.pl episodes data' in your home directory. One is an ser file containing your episode watch data and the other is a config file for setting which videoplayer you'd like to use. If you don't set one mpv will be the default.
